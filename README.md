# EQ

EQ is a lightweight web-based equalizer playground for experimenting with audio EQ settings directly in the browser using standard web technologies (JavaScript, HTML, and CSS). It serves as a simple foundation for building and testing audio processing and visualization ideas without external dependencies.[attached_file:1]

## Features

- Pure front-end implementation using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.[attached_file:1]
- Simple UI scaffold for EQ-style controls (sliders, knobs, or bands) ready for extension.
- Easy to fork and customize for audio experiments, demos, or educational purposes.

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript**: Primary logic and user interactions.[attached_file:1]
- **CSS**: Layout, styling, and responsive design.[attached_file:1]
- **HTML**: Structure and markup.[attached_file:1]

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/okekedev/EQ.git
2. Navigate to the project folder: cd EQ
3. Open `index.html` in your browser, or use a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server, Python's `http.server`, or Node's `http-server`) to avoid CORS issues.

## Project Goals

- Minimal boilerplate for browser-based EQ experiments.
- Iterative development of audio UI/UX for equalizers, filters, and visualizations.
- Small, approachable codebase suitable for teaching or prototyping.

## Roadmap

- Polished equalizer UI with bands, presets, and labels.
- Web Audio API integration for real-time processing.
- Example presets (e.g., bass boost, vocal clarity).
- Testing, linting, and documentation enhancements.

## Contributing

Contributions, ideas, and bug reports welcome via issues or pull requests. Focus areas: UI improvements, audio features, documentation.
